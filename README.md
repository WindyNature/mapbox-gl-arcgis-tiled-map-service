# Mapbox GL Custom Source for ArcGIS Tiled Map Services

This is an unofficial plugin, and is not affliated with Mapbox or Esri. üòá

‚ö†Ô∏èüöß Custom sources are still under development and have not yet been publicly documented. This custom source also depends on code above and beyond the API. This may break with future versions of mapbox-gl. üöß‚ö†Ô∏è

* version 0.1.2 = tested with mapbox-gl-js v0.36.0
* version 0.2.0 = tested with mapbox-gl-js v0.43.0


üö¶Limitationsüö¶
 - The map service must be cached as tiles, see http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/get-started/windows/tutorial-creating-a-cached-map-service.htm
 - The map service must have Web Mercator tiles (srs = 102100 or 3857)

## Installation

```sh
npm install mapbox-gl-arcgis-tiled-map-service

or 
```sh
yarn add mapbox-gl-arcgis-tiled-map-service

  if(err){
    /*do something*/
  }
});

map.addSource('amazon-human-footprint', {
